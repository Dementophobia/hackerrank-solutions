# Solutions for selected HackerRank challenges

This repository contains my solutions to selected [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) challenges. All of them solve the respective challenges with a score of 100%. Of course you should try to solve them yourself first and only use my solutions as guidance if you cannot do them on your own. GL&HF!

## 30 Days of Code

The 30 Days of Code challenges can be found [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code). Once you have started this section, a new challenge will be release every day for your account. This is just a cosmetic feature and if you know the URL to the individual challenges, you can access them right away. I included those URLs as links in the table below, so that you don't have to wait, in case you'd like to progress faster than a single challenge per day.

Please note, that the solutions also contain the fixed stub code of the challenges, which cannot be changed. I didn't fix any code formatting or naming convention issues in those code blocks, so please do expect some weirdness in those areas, as the original stub code  provided by HackerRank isn't as clean as you would like it to be.
